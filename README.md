# Diffusion Modded Image Generator
## Project Overview
The Diffusion Modded Image Generator is a standalone, custom-built product designed for scalable, multi-user stable diffusion fine-tuning and high-quality image generation. This project encompasses the complete lifecycle of model development, from data preprocessing and model training to deployment and documentation, ensuring robust performance, transparency, and accessibility.

## Key Features
- Scalable Multi-User System: Efficiently handles multiple image generation requests using a custom queue-based architecture.
- Stable Diffusion Fine-Tuning: Utilizes a fine-tuned stable diffusion model to produce high-quality, diverse images.
- Comprehensive Documentation: Detailed documentation in a Jupyter Notebook ensures transparency and reproducibility.
- Deployment: Deployed on the Hugging Face platform, providing an accessible inference endpoint for robust performance.
## Technical Details
- Data Processing: Includes extensive data cleaning and augmentation techniques to ensure high-quality input data.
- Model Evaluation: Evaluated using Inception Score (IS) and Frechet Inception Distance (FID) metrics, along with human evaluations.
- Model Architecture: Built on a pre-trained stable diffusion model with additional fine-tuning and regularization techniques to enhance performance.
## Status
This project is currently not available to the public. The repository contains detailed documentation and information about the project, but the code and model are not yet released.

## Future Work
- Release the code and model for public use.
- Continuously improve the model and add new features based on user feedback.
